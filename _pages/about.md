## About Me

* I am currently a 1st year Master of Science student in Business Analytics at Brandeis University. I am focusing on Python, R, SQL, Tableau as well as Git. My undergraduate degree is Financial Engineering and I earned that degree in Sichuan University Chengdu, China. 

* My professional background includes a data analyst full time intern at BigQuant in the strategy department and a data analyst summer intern at Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Some of projects I worked on include predicting the daily house price of Airbnb in Boston and Clustering Analysis of DRGs in healthcare industry.

* I have hands-on exposure in Marketing, Finance, and Healthcare industries.

* Iâ€™m currently working on a project about the China futures market. In this project, we aim to find useful patterns and features, and utilize machine learning and deep learning to determine the right timing to buy and sell. Right now, I am doing an EDA of the dataset and have found some useful patterns such as ARIMA model, time buckets, and those can be powerful features. 

## Interests

* I am a big fan of music. Once I established a music band and I was the leading singer.
* Long-distance running is one of my hobbies. I completed running the third-ring road in Chengdu(30 miles) within 2 days.
