## About Me

* My professional background includes a data analyst full time intern at BigQuant in the strategy department and a data analyst summer intern at Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Some of projects I worked on include predicting the daily house price of Airbnb in Boston and Clustering Analysis of DRGs in healthcare industry.

* I have hands-on exposure in Marketing, Finance, and Healthcare industries.

* Iâ€™m currently working on a project about the China futures market. In this project, we aim to find useful patterns and features, and utilize machine learning and deep learning to determine the right timing to buy and sell. Our team will meet once a week and commit our progress through GitHub every day. Right now, I am doing an EDA of the dataset and have found some useful patterns such as ARIMA model and that can be a powerful feature. 

## Interests
