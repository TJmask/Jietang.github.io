## About me 

My Technical Skills: 
SQL: basics, joins, aggregate functions, subquery, window functions;
R: tidyverse, data table, ggplot2;
Python: Numpy, Pandas, Scikitlearn, matplotlib;
Git: versional control, collaborative programming; 
Tableau: interactive dashboards, informational visualizations;
Statistics: Analytics, Forecasting,  Statistical modeling;
Machine Learning: (Supervised) Xgboost, KNN, Logistics regression, Lasso, Decision Trees, Random Forests; (Unsupervised) PCA, K means clustering  

My industry experience: Marketing | Finance | Healthcare


I am currently a 1st year Master of Science in Business Analytics student at Brandeis University. I am focusing on Python, R, SQL, Tableau as well as Git. My undergraduate degree is Financial Engineering and I earned that degree in Sichuan University Chengdu, China. 

My professional background includes an internship at BigQuant in the Strategy department. There I gained hands-on experience in data mining, data cleaning, modeling(such as financial modeling and statistical modeling), as well as Machine Learning. 
One of the projects I worked on is predicting the daily house price of Airbnb in Boston. In this project, I applied Python to deal with tons of dirty raw data by data cleaning, EDA(explanatory data analysis), feature engineering, machine learning(xgboost, lasso, ridge, random forest). During this project, I solved missing values by KNN and K-means, and extracted newly important features such as holidays, weekend, travel months. In the end, I raised some recommendations such as being a super host,or holding instant bookable rooms tend to attract more customers.  

In addition, Iâ€™m currently working on a project about the China futures market. In this project, we aim to find useful patterns and features, and utilize machine learning and deep learning to determine the right timing to buy and sell. Our team will meet once a week and commit our progress through GitHub every day. Right now, I am doing an EDA of the dataset and have found some useful patterns such as ARIMA model and that can be a powerful feature. 

Also, I am a big fan of music. Once I established a music band and I was the leading singer.
